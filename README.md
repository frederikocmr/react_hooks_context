## React Hooks + Context API Minimal Example

This was made for me in order to understand the new concepts of the React Hooks and Context API.

Here you can see a basic structure of the state management using the store, reducers and states.

### If you want to copy this structure and implement on your need code (fast way)

1. Copy the `./store` folder and put in your code
2. Change the *cartReducer.js* and *userReducer.js* to your own business model, add new reducers if needed.
3. Change the `./state/index.js` to your initial state or add your own models there. 
4. Import and wrap the *StateProvider* to your App main component.

Obs.: To dispatch actions and access the state's data, just check `App.js`.
